# Analysis-on-Wine-Quality
- Domain knowledge is essential and always recommended, especially if you are trying to analyze and model data from diverse domains.
- Wine is an alcoholic beverage made by the process of fermentation of grapes, without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients.
- Red and white wine are two variants.
     1. Red wine is made from dark red and black grapes. The color ranges from various shades of red, brown, and violet. This is produced with whole grapes, including the skin, which adds to the color and flavor of red wines giving it a rich flavor.
     2. White wine is made from white grapes with no skins or seeds. The color is usually straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold. Most white wines have a light and fruity flavor as compared to richer red wines.
     
# Problem Statement
- The given that deals with physicochemical properties of wine and our task is to you guess the wine type and quality.
- The datasets used in this chapter are available in the very popular UCI Machine Learning Repository under the name of Wine Quality Data Set.
- You can access more details at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality, which gives you access to the raw datasets as well as details about the various features in the datasets.
- To be more specific, the wine datasets are related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. - To summarize our main objectives, we will be trying to solve the following major problems by leveraging Machine Learning and data analysis on our wine quality dataset.
     1. Predict if each wine sample is a red or white wine.
     2. Predict the quality of each wine sample, which can be low, medium, or high.

# Approach for Problem Solving
1. Understanding the Problem
2. Downloading the Dataset
3. Importing necessary Dependencies
4. Statastical Analysis
5. Exploratory Data Analysis
6. Feature Engineering
7. Building the Model
8. Evaluation of the Model
9. End Results

# End Results
- We get an overall F1 Score and model accuracy of 99.2%, which is really amazing! 
- In spite of low samples of red wine, we seem to do pretty well.
- This proves that we donâ€™t always need big data but good quality data and features.
- But in case our models did not perform well on other datasets due to a class imbalance problem, we can consider over-sampling or under-sampling techniques including sample selection as well as SMOTE.
