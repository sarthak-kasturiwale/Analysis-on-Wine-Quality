# Analysis-on-Wine-Quality
     Domain knowledge is essential and always recommended, especially if you are trying to analyze and model data from diverse domains.     Wine is an alcoholic beverage made by the process of fermentation of grapes, without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients.     Red and white wine are two variants.     Red wine is made from dark red and black grapes. The color ranges from various shades of red, brown, and violet. This is produced with whole grapes, including the skin, which adds to the color and flavor of red wines giving it a rich flavor.     White wine is made from white grapes with no skins or seeds. The color is usually straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold. Most white wines have a light and fruity flavor as compared to richer red wines.
